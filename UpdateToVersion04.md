When updating from version 0.3 to 0.4, the following aspects have changed and may have to be adjusted.

  * Replace onSelect with onActivate
  * Use the new class names instead of the `data` attribute when initializing from a UL tag.
  * Define `onKeydown` or  `onDblClick` handlers to implement custom behaviour, like selecting a node with double click or expanding a document with `space` key.
  * The css structure has changed and may have to be adjusted for custom skins.
  * Read the documentation: there are lots of other changes and improvemnts to be utilized.
